# send-to-workflowy

An unofficial way to send to Workflowy from anywhere.

## Intro

This repository allows you to send to your Workflowy account from a variety of different sources:

- üï∏ Website
- üîñ Bookmarklet
- üì± iOS / Android (coming soon!)
- ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line

It helps you save links and text for later so you can concentrate on the task in hand.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

Workflowy doesn't have an official API so send-to-workflowy needs some configuration to talk to Workflowy. It doesn't store any of your login information or Workflowy data but it's up to you to keep your Session ID secure.

## Acknowledgements

There's a decade of previous attempts at an unofficial API of sorts for Workflowy. I am most indebted to Malcolm Ocean's opusfluxus for the original code forked to make this repository. Thanks to him and his collaborators.

Thanks to Jesse Patel & team for Workflowy.
